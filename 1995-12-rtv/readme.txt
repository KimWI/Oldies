RTV v1.0PC

        This a sample of RTV, the ray-tracer for voxels, being developed
by me at the Laboratory of Integrated Systems/USP. This demo presents a corn
voxelized by a tomograph, and shows how the segmentation and shading works.

        The keys available are:

X,Y,Z: select the axis to visualize
T: select the threshold level
F: select the initial face for the rendering
+/-: affect all the above functions
S: turns the segmentation mode on/off
L: performs a shading on the corn, making the light turn 360 degrees
arrows: spins the sample cube, shaded with the Gouraud algorithm
