Name: 1993-06-reflex
Language: Pascal
Description: Two-player game for DOS, when a beep sounds, the first one to 
press Shift on the keyboard wins. One player uses left-shift and the other
one uses right-shift.

Name: 1993-07-cryptarithm
Language: Pascal
Description: Cryptharithm for text-mode DOS.

Name: 1993-08-tictactoe4d
Language: Pascal
Description: 4D Tic-Tac-Toe for text-mode DOS. There are two versions, one
is a two-player game, the other is single-player against a minimax AI.

Name: 1994-05-pacman
Language: Pascal
Description: Pac-man clone for text-mode DOS.

Name: 1994-09-freecell
Language: Pascal
Description: Freecell implementation for text-mode DOS. I think this was the
last program I wrote in Pascal.

Name: 1994-11-raytracer
Language: C++
Description: An object-oriented raytracer. I had just learned C++ and thought
it would be a nice language to write a raytracer.

Name: 1995-04-physics
Language: C++
Description: Rudimentary physics simulation: no integration, it just plotted a
trajectory based on parametric equations. I think this was the first expression
evaluator I wrote. In this package there's also a text-based windows manager
called RicardoVision.

Name: 1995-05-arkanoid
Language: C
Description: An arkanoid clone for text-mode DOS.

Name: 1995-05-scancode
Language: C
Description: Prints the scancode of any pressed key on keyboard. We didn't
have home internet to check scan code tables on those days, so I had to
extract them manually.

Name: 1995-07-checkers
Language: C++
Description: A checkers implementation for text-mode DOS. Two-player only, I
didn't write an AI for this.

Name: 1995-09-doom
Language: C++, Assembly x86
Description: Even though it' s called doom, this is actually a wolfenstein
clone. I got a very high frame rate on a 386, but I had only 90-degree walls,
no ceiling or floor (but I did have distance cueing and texture mapping). The
drawing is based on raycasting over a BSP tree, and most time-consuming
tasks were done directly in assembly.

Name: 1995-10-descent
Language: Assembly x86
Description: Improving on the doom clone, I started a descent clone. This
one could place walls on any orientation, but had only flat shading.

Name: 1995-10-firedemocpp
Language: C++
Description: A small demo with a realistic fire animation, written in C++.

Name: 1995-10-firedemoasm
Language: Assembly x86
Description: A small demo with a realistic fire animation, rewritten from
scratch in assembly, since the C++ version was too slow at the time.

Name: 1995-11-sbplayer
Language: C++
Description: A macrolanguage player for SoundBlasters, compatible with the
command PLAY from MSX. I made this three days after buying a SoundBlaster card.

Name: 1995-12-graphicseditor
Language: C++
Description: A small graphics editor for the VGA 256 color mode. I think I
wrote this to draw textures for the doom clone.

Name: 1995-12-rtv
Language: Assembly x86
Description: A real-time raytracer over a voxel field.

Name: 1996-01-engine
Language: Assembly x86
Description: Another 3D graphics engine, this one could place triangles in
general position, with texture mapping and gouraud shading.

Name: 1996-04-gomoku
Language: C++
Description: Text-based Gomoku for DOS, this one had an AI based on heuristics.

Name: 1996-04-videotun
Language: C++
Description: Display a static pattern to calibrate monitors.

Name: 1996-06-asciieditor
Language: C
Description: An ASCII art editor. I used this mostly to write text-based UIs
for my programs. The debug screens from BrMSX were written with this.

Name: 1996-06-boss
Language: C++
Description: A game development library providing low-level access to PC
hardware. Since this accessed the hardware directly, I called it the
Bittencourt Operating System (BOSS). The nicest thing about this was using
operator[] to simulate linear memory arrays in DOS using the XMS driver.

Name: 1996-06-psgplayer
Language: C++
Description: My first emulator! This one emulates the PSG chip from MSX, it
could play MSX tunes on the PC by mapping the PSG registers on the FM
registers of the SoundBlaster. Of course this method had a very low sound
quality when compared to the original.

Name: 1998-12-mp2audio
Language: C
Description: Decodes the header of an mp2 audio file.

Name: 1999-11-fractalcomp
Language: C
Description: Encoder and decoder for a fractal compression scheme. Quality was
nice but it took a long, long time to encode an image.
