have home internet to check scan code tables on those days, so I had to
extract them manually.

for my programs. The debug screens from BrMSX were written with this.

Name: 1996-06-boss
Language: C++
Description: A game development library providing low-level access to PC
hardware. Since this accessed the hardware directly, I called it the
Bittencourt Operating System (BOSS). The nicest thing about this was using
operator[] to simulate linear memory arrays in DOS using the XMS driver.
